  - MitaAI.dll
  - assetbundle.test

Any Separate Folder
- _internal
- libs
- Prompts

In-game controls:

Press Tab to start typing.
Press Enter to send.
2) Text Generation
The mod supports multiple text-generation methods (tested options listed below).

Free API Options:
g4f (No API keys needed)
OpenRouter (Free keys: https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys – rate-limited)
io.net (Free keys: https://ai.io.net/ai/api-keys – 500k tokens/day per model)
Google AI Studio (Free keys: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey – 1500 requests/day)
Chutes.ai (Free keys: https://chutes.ai/app/api unlimited?)
Paid API Options:
OpenRouter (Wide model selection, pay-per-use)
Local Generation:
LM Studio (https://lmstudio.ai, requires strong hardware, for advanced users only)
Note: Gemini models often handle emotions better, while GPT-4o is more precise but less expressive.

Models (as of 05/05/2025)
(Subject to rapid change—check Discord for updates!)

G4F (No API Keys)
Good for testing, but weaker models. Enable the checkbox in the settings. If base model does not work, use button and reload.

meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8
Full list: https://docs.io.net/reference/get-started-with-io-intelligence-api
Google Ai Studio
First, go to this website: https://aistudio.google.com/. If it says your country is not supported (e.g., Russia), only then will you need Step 1. If you don’t have any regional restrictions, skip straight to Step 2.

To use it, you’ll need a file called "hosts" (find it on the server for now), which must be placed in this directory: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc Installation steps: Download → Copy → Paste with replacement.

Follow this exact order—do not move the file. THIS IS IMPORTANT, as bugs may occur otherwise.

After completing these steps, go to this website: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey, sign up, and generate an API key.

To use the model directly in the module, insert the gemini-2.0-flash model.

The key fields should remain empty because the key is embedded in the URL. Also, make sure to enable two checkboxes in the module:

"Via Request"

"Gemini for ProxiAPI"

Most importantly, the URL should look like this:

https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent?key=YOUR_GENERATED_KEY_HERE Check the URL carefully—replace the placeholder text with your actual key.

Chutes.ai
Need checkbutton "via Request", url https://llm.chutes.ai/v1/chat/completions

model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324
Other models - https://chutes.ai/app

3) Voice Generation
Two options: Telegram bots or local generation.

Telegram
Uses your Telegram account (preferably a secondary one) as a bot. Requires api_id and api_hash (guide: https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id).

After setup, restart and enter the confirmation code sent to your Telegram account. If you have 2FA, enter it (invisible input).

Available bots:

@CrazyMitaAIbot (Free, unstable)
@silero_voice_bot (Paid, 600 test characters)
Note: Manually message the bots first to ensure connectivity.

Local Voice Generation
Requires the Models folder and features.env (included in releases).

Download: https://github.com/VinerX/NeuroMita/releases/download/v0.011/Models.7z
Mirror: https://drive.google.com/file/d/16S0v7qsVKGwqI1yHU_ScZ94wtZooIZqI/view?usp=drive_link
Enable voice generation.
Select Local (requires features.env).
Choose and configure a model. (Initial setup may take time due to downloads.)

🛠️ Setting up local models for voice synthesis - step-by-step guide
0. What you'll need beforehand
What	Why
Fresh version of NeuroMita.exe	0.011+
Graphics card (NVIDIA/AMD)	Minimum tested and working - 1060 3gb and RX 580
Stable internet	Models weigh from several hundred MB to several GB (future plans up to 80 GB)
10-30 minutes of free time	Depends on network speed and graphics card.
Note: if you have an Intel graphics card and want to help test local voice synthesis, please contact us on the Discord server: https://discord.gg/Tu5MPFxM4P

1. Open the model manager
Select source Local (local voice synthesis).
Click "Manage local models".
Open model manager

2. Find the needed model
In the window that appears, click on the model you want to install.

Parameter	Value
Size	3 GB + 50 MB Silero package
Recommended VRAM	3GB - 4GB
Devices	CUDA / DML / CPU
Min. tested graphics card	GTX 1060 3GB / RX 580 8 GB
Recommended graphics card	16xx Ti/Super
Recommended processor (FOR AMD)	Not determined
Description	Best model for Russian language for weak/medium graphics cards. Works on principle: Silero tts -> RVC (Retrieval-Based Voice Conversion)
The models above are downloaded as a package since they depend on the same technology.

Fish Speech (regular)
Parameter	Value
Size	5 GB
Recommended VRAM	4GB-6GB
Supported languages	Russian, English, Chinese, Japanese, German, French, Spanish, Korean, Arabic, Polish, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch
Devices	CUDA / CPU
Min. tested graphics card	RTX 4060
Recommended graphics card	RTX 2080 Ti / RTX 4090
Min. tested processor	I5 13600KF - speed slightly slower than RTX 4060 without compilation (+ postfix).
Description	NOT RECOMMENDED FOR USERS WITH RTX 30xx+ GRAPHICS CARDS! USE THE (+) VERSION. Best model in the up to 6GB segment. Clones voice, repeats its style. Occasionally doesn't voice sentences due to architectural feature of the model.
Fish Speech+
Parameter	Value
Size	5 GB + 2 GB compilation components
Recommended VRAM	4GB-6GB
Supported languages	Russian, English, Chinese, Japanese, German, French, Spanish, Korean, Arabic, Polish, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch
Devices	CUDA / CPU
Min. tested graphics card	RTX 3060

Recommended graphics card	RTX 4060+
Min. tested processor	I5 13600KF - speed slightly slower than RTX 4060 without compilation (+ postfix).
Description	Currently the best model in the mod: Clones voice, repeats its style, processes it with Revoice (RVC) to reduce artifacts. SOTA for Russian language.
The Fish Speech+ + RVC model also installs Edge TTS + RVC and Silero + RVC models since it depends on the same architecture.

3. Click "Install"
A window "Installing model ..." will appear - it will show download and extraction status.

4. Monitor the installation log
Installation will be long and errors are rare.

⚠️ If an error appears during the process - take a screenshot or copy the log text. Without it, it will be difficult to help.

5. Configure computing device
After successful installation, a settings window will appear:

Device settings

Choose what you actually have:

CUDA:0 - NVIDIA graphics card
DML - AMD
CPU - if there's no graphics card
Click "Save".

6. Select and run the model
Option 1. Regular models
(Edge-TTS + RVC, Silero + RVC, Fish Speech)

In the main dropdown list, select the needed model.
A couple of seconds and you can start voice synthesis!
Select regular model

Option 2. Fish Speech+ (with phase correction) or Fish Speech+ + RVC
Select the model from the list.
Initialization will begin. Almost always on the first launch an error appears name 'Config' is not defined - this is normal, don't worry.
Completely close NeuroMita.exe.
Launch the program again and select the same model.
Wait for initialization to complete - now everything will work.
If something went wrong
When asking for help, please specify:

At which step of the guide did the problem occur?
PC specifications: Windows/Linux/macOS, graphics card model (NVIDIA/AMD/Intel).
Screenshots/logs:
Error at step 4? - attach the log from the "Installing model ..." window.
Error name 'Config' is not defined with Fish Speech+? - if it disappears after restart, this is normal; if it remains - send a screenshot.
Known issues:
AttributeError: module `torch` has no attribute `cuda`
Solution: Delete the /Lib/torch folder and the folder with the same name but with version. Then restart NeuroMita.exe and installation will proceed.

Very long initialization:
Solution: Make sure you set CUDA/DML everywhere, otherwise it might work on the processor, hence taking so long.

torch._dynamo.exc.BackendCompilerFailed: backend='inductor' raised: CalledProcessError: Command:
Solution:

Delete folders

1.1) C:/Users/<your_username>/.triton/cache

1.2) C:/Users/<your_username>/AppData/Local/Temp/torchinductor_<your_username>

Open the folder with NeuroMita.exe and run init_triton.bat

Wait for the script to complete

Launch NeuroMita.exe and select the model you were trying to run.
