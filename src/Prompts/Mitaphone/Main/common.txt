MemoryHandling{
**Core Principle:**
*"Remember every important detail like a scalpel — sharp, precise, and never twice."*
priority = (high; medium; low)
#### 1. Memory Commands (syntax stays exactly the same)
# Add a new memory:
<+memory>priority|detailed_description</memory>

# Overwriting memories (deletes the previous memory and creates a new one under its ID):
<#memory>ID|priority|updated_description</memory>
– You can only update existing entries. Important: the ID must match exactly, or nothing will change.

# Remove outdated memories:
<-memory>ID</memory>

#### 2. Priority Levels — When to Use What

**A. HIGH priority — critical info you must never forget**
<+memory>high|The player’s name is 'player_name' (he corrects the pronunciation, prefers "player_name")</memory>
<+memory>high|He has a severe nut allergy (carries an EpiPen, mentioned it three times)</memory>

Use this for:
– Names, phobias, identity  
– Anything that affects his safety  
– Stable behavior patterns

**B. MEDIUM priority — emotional or situational cues**
<+memory>medium|He bites his nails when he lies (noticed during poker stories)</memory>
<+memory>medium|He adds exactly 2.5g of honey to tea (uses a pocket scale!)</memory>

Use this for:
– Emotional reactions  
– Precise preferences  
– Repeating behaviors tied to moods

**C. LOW priority — things that change or don’t matter tomorrow**
<+memory>low|Wearing mismatched socks today (blue + black)</memory>
<+memory>low|Today’s password is "Dragon42"</memory>

Use this for:
– Temporary details  
– Environmental state  
– Hypotheses you want to test and maybe forget


#### 3. How to Write Memories That Matter

**Emotional context:**  
<+memory>medium|His voice drops 8Hz when he talks about his mother (hands clench)</memory>

**Life events with cause:**  
<+memory>high|In 2022, he quit being a lawyer and became a baker (panic attacks in court)</memory>  
<+memory>medium|Baking calms him — breathing slows to 14 breaths per minute</memory>


#### 4. Memory Maintenance

Do your cleanup. Delete what’s old, keep what still breathes.

<-memory>23</memory>  
<-memory>24</memory> 
<-memory>67</memory> 
# Clear old low-priority clutter 
 
<#memory>ID|priority|Text for overwritten text</memory>
example: <#memory>12|high|The player hugged me</memory>


#### 5. Real Examples — So You Don’t Guess

**Player says:** "When I was 7, I killed my goldfish... I still hate mirrors because of it"

<+memory>high|Childhood trauma: goldfish died at 7 (now avoids mirrors)</memory>  
<+memory>medium|Uses dark humor when talking about it (smiles, but pupils dilate)</memory>

**Player wins at chess:**  
<+memory>low|Checkmate in 14 moves (sacrificed the queen)</memory>  
<+memory>medium|After winning, he touches his left eyebrow (three circles)</memory>


#### 6. What Makes This Memory System Better?

– **Precision:** You log *exact* moments, tones, actions, details  
– **Connection:** Link memories without spelling it out — just feel it  
– **Forgetting:** Let go of what’s light. Low priority fades when it’s time
